INTRODUCTION						*ucompleteme-intro*

ucompleteme is a Vim plugin for insert-mode completion.  It combines the
results of omni-completion with keywords in the current file.

The thing is, omni-complete works well, but insert mode completion works well
too, and I don't want to think about what kind of completion to use, I just
want Vim to complete the word I'm typing when I press <tab>.  The nice thing
about `ucompleteme` is it does what you would probably want anyway -- it shows
you omni-completeion results followed by the closest matches to your cursor.


USAGE							*ucompleteme-usage*

When you are typing a word and you press the tab key, `ucompleteme` will fill
the pop-up menu with the results of omni-completion.  After that it will search
line-by-line progressively further from your cursor for keywords that match as
well.  This is similar to standard insert-mode completion, except it is
searching both forward and backward.


INSTALLATION						*ucompleteme-install*

Put the "ucompleteme.vim" file in your |runtimepath|, and add the following to
your |vimrc|:

	call ucompleteme#Setup()
